# Euclidean Distance Workflow

## Summary
Finds closest matches by Euclidean distance (optionally excluding within-group matches), then supports assignment from match groups.

## Implementation
- Server/UI + calculator: `R/EuclideanDistance.R`
- Stable join key is `rowid`; ID columns are display-level aliases
