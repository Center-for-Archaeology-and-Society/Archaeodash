\title{Pairwise Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) with Row-Specific Masking}
\usage{
rmse_pairwise(A)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A numeric matrix, where rows are observations and columns are variables.
Zeros in a row indicate that those variables should be ignored when
comparing to other rows.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of size \eqn{n \times n}, where \eqn{n} is the number of
rows in \code{A}. Entry \eqn{D[i, j]} is the RMSE between row \eqn{i} and
row \eqn{j}, computed over the nonzero positions of row \eqn{j}.
The matrix is generally asymmetric because the mask depends on the
reference row \eqn{j}.
}
\description{
Computes a pairwise RMSE-style distance matrix between all rows of a matrix.
For each pair of rows \eqn{(i, j)}, the RMSE is calculated only across
the columns where row \eqn{j} has nonzero entries. This follows the
GAUSS-style masking logic: the denominator is the number of nonzero
entries in row \eqn{j}, and rows with all zeros yield \code{NA} in
their corresponding column of the result.
}
\details{
The calculation for each pair \eqn{(i, j)} is:
\deqn{
  D[i, j] = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{p_j} \sum_{v: A[j, v] \neq 0} (A[i, v] - A[j, v])^2 }
}
where \eqn{p_j} is the number of nonzero entries in row \eqn{j}.
