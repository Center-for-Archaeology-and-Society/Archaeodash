# NAA_analytical_dashboard
Analytical Dashboard for conducting various analysis to group and assess groupings for Neutron Activation Analytical chemical compositional data

Very much a work in progress at this point but includes scripts to assess group membership probabilities using Mahalanobis distances (following Neff 2002) and a procedure for selecting and modifying group membership in biplots. 

INAA_test.csv - test data for the scripts/app
Group_probs.R - Script for assessing probabilities of group membership using Mahalanobis distances
Tabset.R - Draft of Shiny App for reading in, modifying and preparing NAA data for analysis
plot_lasso_updated3.R - Draft of Shiny App for manipulating group membership and viewing biplots of data (work in progress)
