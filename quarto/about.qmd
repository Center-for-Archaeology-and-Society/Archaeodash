# About Archaeodash

This app is under development by Robert Bischoff, Matthew Peeples, and Jeffrey Ferguson. It is designed to facilitate the analysis of elemental data (e.g., portable X-ray fluorescence--PXRF, Neutron Activation Analysis--NAA). It has features for data manipulation, visualization, clustering, ordination (e.g., PCA, LDA), assessment of group membership and more. Andrew Upton contributed to the initial development.

This dashboard is powered by:

- Quarto for static HTML

- Plumber for the API backend

- R for the logic
