Only columns containing numeric data will be available to select as an element concentration.\nImputation Method controls how missing values can be inferred. The underlying Mice package in R has specific requirements which may cause this to fail. Missing values will then be converted to zeroes.\nSelect Transformation controls how the element concentrations are modified. Click the RESET ELEMENTS TO ORIGINAL button to undo a transformation or imputation.\nPRESS TO CONFIRM SELECTIONS must be pressed prior to most operations.
